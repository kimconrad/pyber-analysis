Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib



Importing ride share data from .csv files, analysis in Python using Pandas DataFrames, visualization with Matplotlib.


------------------------------
# Overview of Project
Purpose of analysis is to provide data and visualizations highlighting differences in ride sharing data by city type to be utilized by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Project Tasks
The analysis will include:

1. Summary of ride sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)
2. Multiple-line chart of total fares by city type. 
3. Written analysis

## Resources
-- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

-- Software: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib

# Project Summary

The data shows that ride-sharing varies in significant ways by city type. 

While the overall Total Fares is significantly higher for Urban cities than for Rural areas, there are significantly less drivers in Rural areas. In Rural areas, there is also a considerably higher Average Fare per Driver and per ride, with the Average Fare per Driver being more than three times greater for Rural areas than for Urban areas. 

While Rural and Suburban areas combined still have a lower Total Fares revenue, the higher average Fares per Ride and per Driver show that it is worthwhile to continue to offer services to these markets. The data supports a conclusion that ride sharing services are valuable to both Customers and Drivers in these areas, as Customers are willing to spend more per ride, which in turn benefits Drivers as well. 

As Urban areas show more than double the volume of Total Rides in Rural and Suburban areas combined and more than 60% of the overall Total Fare revenue, it is also clearly worth continuing to invest resources in Urban Areas as well. While the Average Fare for individual rides is slightly lower, the large volume is of considerable value to the overall total.
