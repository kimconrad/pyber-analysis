Module 5: PyBer with Matplotlib



Importing ride share data from .csv files, analysis in Python using Pandas DataFrames, visualization with Matplotlib.


------------------------------
# Overview of Project
Purpose of analysis is to provide data and visualizations highlighting differences in ride sharing data by city type to be utilized by decision-makers at PyBer.

## Project Tasks
The analysis will include:

1. Summary of ride sharing data by city type (Urban, Suburban, Rural).
2. Multiple-line chart of total fares by city type. 
3. Written analysis.

## Resources
-- Data Source: city_data.csv, ride_data.csv

-- Software: Python, Pandas, Matplotlib


-------------------------------


# Project Results
-- Analysis Output: visualization figures from Matplotlib.

While the overall Total Fares is significantly higher for Urban cities than for Rural areas, there are also significantly less Total Drivers and Total Rides in Rural areas. In Rural areas, there are considerably higher Average Fares per Driver and per Ride, with the Average Fare per Driver being more than three times greater for Rural areas than for Urban areas. 

As Urban areas show more than double the volume of Total Rides in Rural and Suburban areas combined and more than 60% of the overall Total Fare revenue, it is clearly worth continuing to invest resources in Urban Areas. While the Average Fare per individual Ride is slightly lower, the large volume of rides is of considerable value to the overall total revenue. While Rural and Suburban areas combined still have lower Total Fares revenue than Urban areas, the higher Average Fares per Ride and per Driver show that it is also worthwhile to continue to offer services to these markets.

# Project Summary

The data shows that ride-sharing varies in significant ways by city type. However, ride sharing provides an important service in each of these regional areas. 

The data supports a conclusion that ride sharing services are valuable to both Customers and Drivers in Rural and Suburban areas, as Rural Customers are willing to spend more per ride, which in turn benefits Drivers as well. Continuing to support existing infrastructure in these areas in a targeted way is of direct benefit to these communities, which each Driver and each Customer making up a larger piece of the overall totals. 
From the high volume of rides in Urban areas, the data also shows that ride sharing services are heavily relied on by both Customers and Drivers in these areas as well. Recommend continuing broad-based support of existing Drivers in Urban markets and exploring further expansion of Driver capacity as needed, as there looks to be a high potential for continued growth in these areas.
